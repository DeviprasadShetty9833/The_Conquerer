# Overview:

This is a simple, interactive combat game built using Python and Pygame, offering a fun grid-based combat experience between a human player and an AI opponent.Players can select difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Hard), place their ships, and engage in strategic turn-based attacks, all within a visually appealing UI rendered via Pygame.

# Key Features:

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.-Difficulty_Levels-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Choose from Easy (6√ó6), Moderate (8√ó8), or Hard (10√ó10) game boards for varying complexity.

<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/2.-Ship_Placement-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Place 8 ships on your grid by clicking cells on the left board before starting the game.

<br> ![3.](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.-AI_Opponent-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> AI randomly places its ships and responds with basic strategic attacks after your turn.

<br> ![4.](https://img.shields.io/badge/4.-Turn_Based_Gameplay-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Players and AI take turns attacking each other's grids ‚Äî green circles indicate hits, black for misses.

<br> ![5.](https://img.shields.io/badge/5.-Real_Time_Feedback-34A853?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> A message panel and ship hit counter keeps players informed about the current state of the match.

<br> The first to sink all 8 enemy ships wins the game. Game over messages are shown at the end.

# Concepts Used:
<br> Programming Language: Python 3.X
<br> Libraries: Pygame ( for graphics, events, rendering ), NumPy( for Grid ) 

Core Concepts:
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Event-driven programming
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Grid generation using NumPy
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Collision handling (mouse clicks & grid mapping)
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Turn-based state machine logic
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† AI logic with random attack generation

# How to use:

üîß Setup:

<br> 1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
<br> 2. Install Pygame if not already:
```python
pip install pygame
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Game:

<br> 1. Copy the source code from the file : [src.py](https://github.com/DeviprasadShetty9833/The_Conquerer/blob/main/src.py)
<br> 2. Paste the code on a Python file & save it as ' **The Conquerer.py** '.

üéÆ Controls:

<br> 1. Click on the grid boxes on Left board to place your ships( BLUE boxes ).
<br> 2. Click on grid boxes on Right board to fire shots on AI's ships( GREEN dots ).
